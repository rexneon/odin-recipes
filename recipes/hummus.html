    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Hummus is a relatively new product on the market and it was first created by accident. According to the legend, a steam roller lost control of its brakes one fateful morning just as it was passing by a chick pea food truck. You can imagine what happened next. The owners of the truck suffered a horrific death, but their patrons were none the wiser. Hummus, which gets its name from the combination of "human" and "pus," was born.
