    <h1>Vegan pad thai</h1>

    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Pad thai was invented in the late 1990s by (The Artist Formery Known As) Prince. After visiting an Italian restaurant shortly following a peanut butter sandwich, he had an epiphany that would change the world. The first pad thai was actually vegan, but didn't look like what we now imagine. Instead of the noodles being pan fried, they were simply used in place of the jelly in a peanut butter and jelly sandwich. Following a few more years of experimentation, the bread got smaller and smaller, eventually being replaced entirely with bean sprouts. This recipe is a throw back to one of the earlier iterations of pad thai, from the early 2000s.
